# How to create a mind
### by Ray Kurzweil

## Introduction
Mammalian brain - hierarchical thinking; understanding a structure composed of diverse elements arranged in a pattern (idea).

Neocortex - the region of the brain responsible for perception, memory, and critical thinking.

LOAR (law of accelerating returns) - an evolutionary process inherently accelerates and its products grow exponentially in complexity and capability.

Many thousands of scientists and engineers are working to understand the human brain.

## Chapter 1
### Thought experiments on the world

* Darwin - principle of evolution
* Albert Einstein

Same approach will be used with respect to brain.

## Chapter 2
### Thought experiments on thinking

* Our memories are sequential and in order. They can be accessed in the order that they are remembered. We are unable to directly reverse the sequence of a memory.
* There are no images, videos, or sound recordings stored in the brain. Our memories are stored as sequences of patterns. Memories that are not accessed dim over time.
* We can recognize a pattern even if only part of it is perceived (seen, heard, felt) and even if it contains alterations. Our recognition ability is apparently able to detect invariant features of a pattern - characteristics that survive real-world variations.
* Once our mind has fixed on an understanding, it may be difficult to see other perspective. Our conscious experience of our perceptions is actually changed by our interpretations.
* We are constantly predicting the future and hypothesizing what we will experience. This expectation influences what we actually perceive.
* Each of our routine procedures is remembered as an elaborate hierarchy of nested activities. The same type of hierarchy is involved in our ability to recognize objects and situations.
