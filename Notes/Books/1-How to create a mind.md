# How to create a mind
by Ray Kurzweil

## Introduction
Mammalian brain - hierarchical thinking; understanding a structure composed of diverse elements arranged in a pattern (idea).

Neocortex - the region of the brain responsible for perception, memory, and critical thinking.

LOAR (law of accelerating returns) - an evolutionary process inherently accelerates and its products grow exponentially in complexity and capability.

Many thousands of scientists and engineers are working to understand the human brain.
