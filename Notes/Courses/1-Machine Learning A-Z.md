##### Basic models of machine learning
* Regression - anything to predict a real value
* Classification - to predict the category, like doing some customer segmentations
* Clustering

##### Data preprocessing
* In any machine or any model we are going to use some independent variables to predict a dependent variable.
* Categorical data
* Dummy encoding

##### Movies
* iRobot
* Ex Machina
